# vite-react-node-api-one-directory

This is a one-directory project that has:

- Vite React frontend
- Node/Express backend

It is meant to be used as a local application that has a JSON-file database.

If you want to put it online at e.g. Vercel, you will have to dynamically (.env file) disable any pages that use the backend while online.
